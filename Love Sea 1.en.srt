1
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Hello.

2
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,200
I’m on board.

3
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,720
Will you just stop nagging?
It’s annoying.

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,800
Hey, I’m starting to wonder why
you’re so insistent on me going south.

5
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,560
I won’t be lonely to death.

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,160
I’m hanging up.

7
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,440
Finishing up early today, P’ Mut?

8
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,320
Someone like you know how to get tired?

9
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,440
I’ve got an appointment.

10
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,720
What appointment?

11
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,400
Come on, hand it over.

12
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,800
So, what appointment do you have?

13
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,800
Need help?

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
What appointment?

15
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,560
Won’t you really tell me?

16
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,280
You’re keeping secrets from your bro now?

17
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,720
I’m your bro, P’ Mut.

18
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
You’re ignoring me?

19
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,040
I’m gonna pack up.

20
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,840
Suit yourself, bro.

21
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh, shit!

22
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,320
Ai Palm!

23
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Go down and pick it up.

24
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,640
Are you crazy?
Don’t you know how deep it is?

25
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,640
You wanna know?

26
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,320
Dive in and see for yourself.

27
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,240
You’re so mean.

28
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,800
I’m your bro, man.

29
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,000
Damn, this spot is fucking deep too.

30
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
P’ Mut, you bastard!

31
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,680
Love Sea the Series

32
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,760
(Heaven on Earth)

33
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,200
More like hell on earth.

34
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
It’s all that bastard’s fault.

35
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,720
Heard your new novel is about the ocean.

36
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,159
Why not spend two weeks on an island?

37
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,840
I’ve booked you a plane ticket and a yacht.

38
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,720
Your good friend, C. Worrington.

39
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,840
Don’t bail.

40
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,280
P.S. Don’t be lonely to death, baby.

41
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,200
Who’s lonely, you goddamn friend?

42
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,120
And where’s the guy
who’s supposed to pick me up?

43
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,400
(Southern dialect)
Are you Khun Tongrak?

44
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,240
Don’t tell me…

45
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,800
You’re the guy who’s picking me up?

46
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,800
(Southern dialect) Yes.

47
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,440
Are you crazy?

48
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,600
How am I supposed to fit
my stuff on your bike?

49
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,720
Look, do you know how
expensive these suitcases are?

50
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,560
What will you do if they get damaged?

51
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
Whatever it takes

52
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,480
find me a better ride or I won’t get on.

53
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,560
I’m borrowing it.

54
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,200
(Southern dialect) I’ve got it covered.

55
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,800
(Heaven on Earth)

56
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,360
I’m going home!

57
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,600
Stop!
Take me back right now!

58
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,280
I want to go home!

59
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,600
(Southern dialect) You’re not getting off?

60
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,160
Hello.

61
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,760
I’m going home.

62
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,280
What do you mean?
You’ve just arrived.

63
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,000
Exactly.

64
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,800
Do you have any idea
what I’ve been through?

65
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,040
You said coming south
would spark ideas for my work.

66
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,720
That it’d help inspire me to write the novel.

67
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,280
What a bull, Connor.

68
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
I have a hangover,
haven’t gotten a wink of sleep.

69
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
Not only am I seasick,
but you just had to go and send…

70
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,960
an... an idiot to pick me up.

71
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,120
I can’t understand a single word he says.

72
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,800
And do you know what he made me ride on?

73
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,960
What?

74
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
A cargo tricycles,
you goddamn farang!

75
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Do you know what it is?

76
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,560
Whatever.

77
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,160
I’m catching the next
available boat back home.

78
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,880
If there’s none

79
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,600
I’ll call to book a yacht.
Give…

80
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,240
Hey!

81
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,640
Give it back.

82
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,200
This is Mahasamut speaking, Khun Connor.

83
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,200
You can speak the Central dialect?

84
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,400
There’s no problem.

85
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,040
I’ll take good care

86
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,760
of Khun Tongrak.

87
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I can somewhat tell.

88
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,680
He’s pretty stubborn.

89
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,640
Give it to me.

90
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,160
I got this.

91
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,880
You don’t need to worry.

92
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Yes.

93
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,360
He’s making kitty eyes now.

94
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,160
You can rest assured.

95
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,600
Enjoy your trip with Ai Kom.

96
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,840
Not only did you take jobs from Connor

97
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,160
but you also know his boyfriend, Ai Kom?

98
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,120
Keep your mouth shut for all I care.

99
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,240
Because I’m leaving anyway.

100
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,240
How beautiful.

101
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
(Southern dialect) Khun Tongrak.

102
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,160
(Southern dialect) Welcome

103
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
(Southern dialect) to our island.

104
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,480
Chapter 1:
Love Begins with the Flick of a Pen

105
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,560
(Sothern dialect) Is there
anything else I can do for you?

106
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,680
No.

107
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,600
(Sothern dialect) Then…

108
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,080
I said no.

109
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,360
Just get out of here.
I don’t understand what you say.

110
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,400
(Southern dialect) I said

111
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,080
(Southern dialect) Is there
anything else I can do for you?

112
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,040
(Southern dialect) You’re so mean.

113
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,800
(Southern dialect) I guess it’s true
when people say pretty faces are mean.

114
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Go away!

115
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,360
(Southern dialect) I just want to say,
feel free to call me if you need anything.

116
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,760
(Southern dialect)
My number’s right by the bed.

117
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,560
(Mahasamut)

118
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,040
Why did I let him get under my skin?

119
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,200
Because he was so persistent!

120
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,960
I don’t feel like working anymore.

121
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,920
Open up, you stupid suitcase.

122
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,480
Yes, P’ Pat.

123
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,880
P’ Rak has gone down south to
work on a novel for two weeks.

124
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,720
You know how hard it is to reach
him when he’s in writer mode.

125
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,240
I get it about the manuscript.

126
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,880
But if P’ Rak doesn’t send it to me,
I can’t send it to you either.

127
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
I’ll send you the manuscript
as soon as I get it from him.

128
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,160
Yes, sis.

129
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,680
Oh, the stage appearance at the Book Fair?

130
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,040
I’ll remind P’ Rak again next month.

131
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,520
Gosh, what a hectic day!

132
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,360
Just a second.

133
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,960
Found it.

134
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,880
I’m at my limit.

135
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,960
This is only the first day without P’ Rak.

136
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,840
First day.

137
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
What a mess.

138
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Sawasdee ka.

139
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,560
P’ R ak has gone down south
to work on a novel for two weeks.

140
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,600
Please relay your business with him to me.

141
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,280
Ai Rak is away for two whole weeks?

142
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,640
Yes.

143
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,000
Then you must’ve had some free time.

144
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,640
Since Mr. Popular Writer is away,
how can Ms. Secretary be busy?

145
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,160
As his best friend

146
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,240
I'll see to it that you work
to meet the salary he’s paying you.

147
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,040
No, I’m very busy, P’ Vi.

148
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,600
- We’re about to start filming.
- Really busy.

149
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,240
Okay.

150
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,320
I have to get back to filming.

151
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,360
I'll let you know later what you need to do.

152
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,280
Bye.

153
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,120
- Bye.
- P’ Vi. Hold on, P’ Vi.

154
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,920
Listen to me.

155
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,720
I’m really...

156
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,600
busy.

157
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,360
Nobody listens to me at all.

158
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,360
P’ Rak, you’d better work hard and not goof off.

159
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,840
Don’t let me suffer from
P’ Vi’s mood swings for nothing.

160
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,839
People say that bars usually have
at least one exciting event each night.

161
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,680
I bet tonight is no different.

162
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,400
What can I get you?

163
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
One glass of Gin Martini.

164
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,920
Martini.

165
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,360
One glass.

166
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,160
Could tonight’s story involve this beauty?

167
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,640
What a fucking beautiful guy!

168
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,400
He’s exactly my bro’s type.

169
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,240
Mahasamut.

170
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,520
Are you P’ Mut’s guest?

171
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,520
What’s it to you?

172
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,560
Nothing.
I just heard P’ Mut’s name.

173
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,400
Beautiful name, isn’t it?

174
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,280
So?

175
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,440
What the heck? That’s it?

176
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,200
Don’t you know that everyone here

177
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,480
would totally pounce on the chance
to ask about him from me?

178
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Who’d want to know?

179
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,560
Plenty.

180
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,800
P’ Mut’s the island's celebrity.
I’m sitting down.

181
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,200
He’s the island's celebrity.

182
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,240
Women practically swoon over how hot he is.

183
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,240
Just the other day, some Japanese
girls were raving about his coolness.

184
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,480
Oh!

185
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,800
And it's not just the girls.

186
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,040
P’ Mut is open to guys too.

187
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,080
There. See the farang at that table?

188
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,480
Over there.

189
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,640
He’s extending his stay because of P’ Mut.

190
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,640
Huh?

191
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,280
With that guy?

192
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,040
So…

193
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,440
Why are you telling me this?

194
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,240
In case you’re interested.

195
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,280
I’d never!

196
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,480
If you say so.
I’d better relay the order.

197
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,200
- What the heck?
- Hey, Hold on!

198
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,640
Why? Interested now?

199
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,240
Right?

200
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,080
No.

201
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,040
Why do you think I’d be
interested in that guy?

202
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,760
I don’t know if you’re interested or not.

203
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,000
I just…

204
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,280
Just?

205
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,400
I just wanna let everyone know that

206
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,160
the treasure of this island
goes by the name Mahasamut.

207
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,920
See ya.

208
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,480
Gonna relay the order.

209
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,320
Took you so long just to order one drink.

210
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,960
Today, I got to deliver my cool slogan again.

211
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
Hey, what about your drink?

212
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,960
Have it charged to my room.

213
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,920
And if he’s the best this place got,
I don’t want the rest either.

214
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,760
The heck?

215
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,920
(Southern dialect) Oh Mut,
you’re here early today.

216
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,520
(Southern dialect) Are there
lots of guests today, Auntie?

217
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,160
(Southern dialect) Not really.
It’s usually jam-packed on holidays.

218
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,600
(Southern dialect)
Let me know if you need any help.

219
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,160
(Southern dialect)
Alright, just go to work.

220
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,960
(Southern dialect) Thanks.

221
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,040
Hey, Nong Mut.

222
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Listen, kid.

223
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,560
Guests are asking about diving trips.
Are you free during this period?

224
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,160
No, I’m booked.

225
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,880
For two weeks.

226
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,040
Dayum, you’ve really got your hands full!

227
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,800
By the way, don’t forget
to take your mom to the doctor.

228
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,760
It's her time for a checkup.

229
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,240
What a thoughtful kid!

230
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Thanks so much for reminding me.

231
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,880
- No problem.
- I’ll give my mom a call.

232
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
(Southern dialect) Take it easy
or you might hurt your waist.

233
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,480
(Southern dialect) Here, let me help.

234
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,480
(Southern dialect) It's alright, Ai Mut.
This is my job.

235
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,360
(Southern dialect) It doesn’t matter
as long as the job’s finished.

236
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,960
(Southern dialect) Ai Mut,
you’re stealing this old man's job.

237
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,760
(Southern dialect) It's because
you’ve got a bad waist.

238
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,840
(Southern dialect) Fine.

239
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
(Southern dialect)
By the way, thanks for the other day.

240
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,640
(Southern dialect) You went to the
mainland to buy my grandson a gift.

241
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
(Southern dialect) Did he like it?

242
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,400
(Southern dialect) He even carried
it with him when he took a shower.

243
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,720
(Southern dialect) Happy to help.

244
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,600
(Southern dialect) Let’s go.

245
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,680
Go away!

246
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,280
(Southern dialect) I just want to say,
feel free to call me if you need anything.

247
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,600
(Southern dialect)
My number’s right by the bed.

248
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,080
(Southern dialect) And I was going to say

249
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,680
(Southern dialect)
that you didn’t take all the keys.

250
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,240
I'm leaving my friend with you for two weeks.

251
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,600
A stubborn, wayward, lonely soul
who’ll wither away without me for a month.

252
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Is your friend a man or a dog?

253
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,400
More like a cat.

254
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,560
You’ll know when you see him.

255
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,240
You speak like I’ve already agreed.

256
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,840
(35,000 baht received.)

257
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,760
I’ll take good care of him.

258
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,200
Any heads-up?

259
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,360
Don’t get scratched and
don’t let him wither away.

260
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
He’s got a lonely heart.

261
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,960
Time to raise a cat.

262
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,720
(Southern dialect) Good morning.

263
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,560
Go…

264
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,440
(Southern dialect) What? I can’t hear you.

265
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,200
- Go…
- (Southern dialect) What?

266
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,160
- (Southern dialect) I can’t understand you.
- Go to hell!

267
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,880
(Southern dialect) Good morning.

268
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,160
What are you babbling about?

269
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,520
How did you get into my room?
Get out.

270
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,440
(Southern) Here.

271
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
(Southern dialect) Your key.

272
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,600
(Southern dialect) When you chased me
out yesterday, you didn’t ask about it.

273
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,360
(Southern dialect) I thought you didn’t
want it anymore, so I kept it for you.

274
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,280
Crazy bastard!

275
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,240
(Southern dialect) You call me crazy?

276
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,600
(Southern dialect)
That says a lot about you.

277
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,640
Stupid blanket!

278
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,880
(Southern dialect) So fair.

279
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,080
You wanna see?

280
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,760
I’ll let you see.

281
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,000
(Southern dialect) Wow.

282
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,040
(Southern dialect) Really fair.

283
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,400
(Southern dialect) Very fair.

284
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,400
(Southern dialect)
Just like you’ve been bleached.

285
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,400
(Southern dialect) But…

286
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,920
(Southern dialect) You don’t
have any body hair at all.

287
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,600
(Southern dialect) Laser removed or shaved?

288
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,320
(Southern dialect)
Does it feel itchy when it grows back?

289
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,480
(Southern dialect)
It’s super itchy when mine does.

290
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,240
(Southern dialect) Excuse me.

291
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,480
(Southern dialect) Holy cow!

292
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,160
(Southern dialect)
Smooth like a peeled pear.

293
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,600
(Southern dialect) Huh?

294
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,920
(Southern dialect)
Do you have a fever, Khun Tongrak?

295
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,040
(Southern dialect) Your cheeks are red.

296
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,960
(Southern dialect)
Need medicine? Well?

297
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
(Southern dialect) Why are you mad at me?

298
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,840
(Southern dialect) Come on,
I’ll take you for a walk, oops.

299
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,360
(Southern dialect)
I mean, take you to a shower.

300
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,520
(Southern dialect) I’m gonna take
you out for some delicious food.

301
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,640
Don’t you feel anything at all?

302
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,600
Not a single bit?

303
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
(Southern dialect) What?

304
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,360
You blockhead.
Just go to hell for all I care!

305
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,080
(Southern dialect) Why are you angry?

306
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,880
Go away!

307
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,920
He’s a kitty, no doubt.

308
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,600
My charm didn’t work?

309
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,000
Someone like me failed?

310
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,160
I thought he was open to guys too.

311
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,360
Remember, Ai Rak.

312
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,520
Even if he were the last man on Earth

313
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,760
don’t go for him.

314
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,160
Leave me alone.

315
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,880
(Southern dialect) I can’t do that.

316
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
(Southern dialect)
I’ve accepted the money.

317
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,720
I don’t understand.

318
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,560
Do you hear me?
I. Don’t. Understand.

319
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,800
And I don’t eat rice soup.

320
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,360
(Southern dialect) Picky.

321
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,280
I don’t eat sausages or fried eggs.

322
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,120
I don’t eat rice in the morning.
Too heavy for my stomach.

323
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,200
(Southern dialect) Yummy?

324
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,880
I’m full.

325
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,640
Since you brought all these foods

326
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,800
finish all the leftovers.

327
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,680
(Southern dialect)
You’re so kind, Khun Tongrak.

328
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,280
(Southern dialect)
How did you know I was tired?

329
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,720
(Southern dialect)
You’re so beautiful and kind.

330
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,920
(Southern dialect) Your fair skin
reflects the purity of your heart.

331
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,480
(Southern dialect) I’m so lucky

332
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,040
(Southern dialect) to have
been able to take care of you.

333
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,880
Look.

334
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,840
How much do I need to pay you
to stop getting on my nerves?

335
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,840
(Southern dialect) Money can’t buy me.

336
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,760
If it’s not enough.

337
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,040
(Southern dialect) Is that my number?

338
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,280
(Southern dialect)
I thought you didn’t care.

339
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,920
(5,000 baht received.)

340
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,920
Is 5,000 enough?

341
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,000
(Southern dialect) Yes?

342
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
For you to speak
the Central dialect with me.

343
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,600
(7,000 baht received.)

344
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,600
What about 7,000?

345
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,080
- 10,000?
- (10,000 baht received.)

346
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,920
(15,000 baht received.)

347
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,080
What about 15,000?

348
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,000
What?

349
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,720
Too cheap for your rate?

350
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,040
Come on.

351
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,200
You had me at 5,000.

352
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,320
Don’t you feel anything at all
when I look down on you?

353
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,280
Nope.

354
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,400
In fact, I’m happy that you’ve bought me.

355
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,000
From here on out, I won’t
let you out of my sight.

356
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,840
Why are you following me?

357
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,120
I’m afraid you’ll get tired.

358
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,920
Keeping your chin up like that
will strain your neck.

359
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,600
See? Quite an angle you have here.

360
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,920
None of your business.

361
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,800
I’m just worried.

362
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,400
Ever since you got here,
you’ve only displayed two faces.

363
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,360
Arrogant and embarrassed.

364
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,680
- Who’s embarrassed?
- Angry face too.

365
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,280
Too much anger can lead to wrinkles.

366
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,920
- None of your business.
- I beg to differ.

367
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,120
Your business is my business too.

368
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
Because I’m your sitter, oops.

369
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,040
Your guide.

370
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,800
It's my job to look after you
and keep an eye on your mood.

371
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,520
I have to bathe and brush your hair, oops.

372
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,960
Keep you pleased.

373
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,000
I’m so pitiful.

374
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,920
My good intentions are taken the wrong way.

375
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,960
Ai Mut's such a pitiful guy.

376
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,200
Khun Connor told me
you’ve come here to write a novel.

377
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,800
Yes. So what?

378
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
I’ll show you around the island.

379
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,080
No matter where you seek
information—be it underwater, on land

380
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,800
or in any corner of
the island—I know it all.

381
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,880
Having a local around will
make you feel more at ease.

382
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,960
When did I ask you for help?

383
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,160
Khun Connor’s paid me,
so it's my job to take care of you.

384
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,800
My principle is: money
comes, work gets done.

385
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
If you don’t let me work

386
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,920
I'll have to return the money.

387
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,120
The entire island is aware
that I'm fully booked

388
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,280
so they've probably hired
someone else by now.

389
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,679
Don’t you feel sorry for this innocent
guy who's struggling to make ends meet?

390
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,960
More importantly.

391
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,600
Do you know how to ride a motorcycle?

392
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,000
You might not be aware, but there
are no cars for rent on this island.

393
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Only motorcycles.

394
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,159
How are you going to
get around without Ai Mut?

395
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,159
And more importantly.

396
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,840
I can do more than just being a guide.

397
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,040
Whether you buy me or not...

398
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
the choice is yours.

399
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,200
I can see you’re interested.

400
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,560
Even if you were the last man
on Earth, I still wouldn’t want you.

401
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,040
We’ll see about that.

402
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,960
Watch your step.

403
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,760
Mind your own business!

404
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm swamped right now, P' Vi.
I don’t have free time at all.

405
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,720
Even with P’ Rak away,
I still have a ton on my plate.

406
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,960
I have to deal with
the copyright sales contract

407
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,960
and translate two novels into English.

408
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,560
So busy.

409
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,960
Don’t do that, Ai Mook.

410
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,840
If you use a high-pitched voice,
P' Vi won't believe what you say.

411
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
What should I do?

412
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
How about this?

413
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,160
I must speak the honest truth, P’ Vi.

414
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,800
I’m P’ Rak’s secretary, not yours.

415
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,400
Nobody uses ‘honest truth’ in real life.

416
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,840
My brain’s fried from all those novels.

417
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,800
Call me if you dare, P’ Vi.

418
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,960
I’ve been practicing
my speech for two days.

419
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,200
Yes, P’ Vi?

420
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,920
(How to Deal With P’ Vi)

421
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,680
(If she asks you over, refer to page...)

422
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,520
My room's light bulb is busted.

423
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,400
Light bulb?

424
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,640
What?

425
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,280
(If she needs a driver...)
(if she seeks counsel...)

426
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,960
(If she chews you out...)
(If she has personal issues...)

427
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Not on the list.

428
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,920
What are you talking about?

429
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,040
I said, my room's light bulb is busted.

430
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,200
It’s nothing.

431
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,640
And what’s your point?

432
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,080
You have to change it for me.

433
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,120
Huh?

434
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,240
Why me?

435
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,480
Mook, do I have to spell it out for you?

436
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,720
You’re Ai Rak’s secretary, correct?

437
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,400
So, it’s only right for you
to change the light bulb for me.

438
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,440
That doesn't make any sense.

439
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,000
Ai Rak owns more than
10 condo units for rent.

440
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,400
And I’m one of his tenants.
I hope we’re on the same page about this.

441
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,640
As Rak's secretary,
you handle everything for him

442
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,400
from matters related to
his novels to rental collections.

443
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,040
So, it’s your duty to
deal with any room issues.

444
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,520
But… But I...

445
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,680
Let me tell you again.

446
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,080
My room's light bulb is busted.

447
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,480
But…

448
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,200
And I don’t like it when my room's dark.

449
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
So, I’ll give you two days.

450
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,920
Find some free time to
change the light bulb for me.

451
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,240
Don’t call an electrician.

452
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,400
If they’re a fan of mine,
they’ll find out my address.

453
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,480
And if you tell me to change it myself

454
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,960
I’ll remind you that
I’m a frail lead actress

455
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,640
who can’t do anything on her own.

456
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,840
If the light bulb cuts my
finger and leaves a wound

457
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,400
it will disrupt
the continuity of the filming.

458
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,560
That's all I have to say.

459
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,320
I won't take any more of your time.

460
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,160
Goodbye.

461
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,520
P’ Vi, wait a second.

462
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,960
Hold on, P’ Vi.

463
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,760
P’ Vi.

464
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,200
Sorry, Mook.

465
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,920
I happen to be a frail woman
who can’t change a light bulb.

466
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,280
A frail woman, indeed.

467
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,440
Can you tell me why you
have to have sex with someone

468
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,280
when writing a love scene?

469
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,480
I wish I knew.

470
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,280
So, you're saying
you have to keep doing it?

471
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,000
Have sex to write about sex?

472
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,960
Find someone to hold
just to write about love?

473
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,360
It’s one of those scenes again.

474
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,880
(Mahasamut)

475
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,280
More importantly.

476
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,520
I can do more than just being a guide.

477
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,080
Khun Tongrak.

478
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,240
Shall we have a truce?

479
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
His sharp gaze remains
fixed on the beautiful tears

480
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,120
streaming down blushing cheeks.

481
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,520
A sudden ache fills his chest inexplicably.

482
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,600
He doesn’t understand why it hurts.

483
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,600
Why he yearns to pull
the slender body into an embrace.

484
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,720
Why he cannot bear to witness
this person's tears.

485
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,800
He doesn’t understand at all.

486
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,240
What exactly is love?

487
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,560
Is this philosophy?

488
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,760
I’m working.

489
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,360
Hey, my work!

490
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,320
This fancy laptop comes
with an auto-save feature.

491
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:32,680
Let’s go.

492
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,400
To where?

493
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,760
You should take a break.

494
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,800
I’ll show you some good stuff.

495
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,680
- Come on.
- I’m going to work.

496
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,760
Come on, get up.

497
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,480
Chop chop!

498
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,720
Sit tight.

499
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,280
You’re not a kid anymore.

500
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,160
If you fall, I won't be
diving in to fetch you.

501
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,520
Hello, Mook.

502
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,840
What’s up?

503
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,240
Hello?

504
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,000
Hello?

505
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,880
I'm getting a bad signal.

506
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,040
Say that again.

507
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,000
Hello?

508
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,880
Hello, Mook.

509
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,800
Khun Tongrak.

510
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,160
We’re in the middle of the ocean.

511
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,440
There’s no signal around here.

512
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,640
Get lost.

513
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,880
I just meant well.

514
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,920
I didn’t ask for it.

515
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,080
Fine, don’t talk to me.

516
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,480
Mook.

517
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,360
Come again?

518
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,320
What?

519
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,640
No way.

520
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,360
Did he fall into the water?

521
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,640
Mahasamut.

522
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,000
Mahasamut!

523
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,480
Mahasamut!

524
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,160
Mahasamut!

525
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,360
Mut!

526
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:37,840
Mut!

527
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,160
Hey, have you ever had clams
in the middle of the ocean?

528
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,560
Are you crying?

529
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,760
You were on the phone,
so I didn’t bother you.

530
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,040
I didn't want to get told
I have no manners.

531
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,880
I’m fine.

532
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,440
Look at me.
I’m completely fine.

533
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,680
I’m sorry, Khun Tongrak.

534
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,000
Please don’t cry.

535
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,840
Let me wipe your tears.

536
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,200
I thought you fell into the water.

537
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,160
I thought you wouldn’t come back up.

538
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,080
I thought you were going to die.

539
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,320
Is it fun messing with me like that?

540
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,440
No matter how much I hate you,
I don’t want to see you die.

541
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,200
Do you want to see me
die from a heart attack?

542
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,280
- I’m sorry, Khun Tongrak.
- You bastard.

543
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,520
I’m sorry.

544
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,040
- Let me go!
- It’s all my fault.

545
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,200
I’m sorry.

546
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,080
I’m sorry.

547
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,280
I’m sorry.

548
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,360
I’m sorry.

549
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,080
Please forgive me.

550
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,480
Here.

551
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,040
Use it.

552
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,160
Your eyes are puffy from crying.

553
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,680
I didn’t ask for it.

554
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,040
No.

555
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,120
You didn't.

556
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,920
Just like how you didn’t cry.

557
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,160
Hey!

558
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,040
Why are you taking your top off?

559
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,920
Because it’s wet.

560
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,560
Who told you to jump into the water?

561
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,520
Didn’t I tell you
I’d show you some good stuff?

562
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,800
This is good stuff too.

563
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,040
But I was talking about clams.

564
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,040
Which do you want to feast on?

565
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,440
But I think I can guess

566
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,600
what you’re hungry for.

567
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,480
Get over yourself.
You’re such a pervert.

568
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,960
No pervert is this handsome.

569
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,120
I’m more handsome than you.

570
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,280
Can’t argue with that.

571
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,280
So...

572
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,280
Which do you want to eat?

573
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,640
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

574
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,760
I’ll let you see.

575
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,880
Yes, I want to see!
