1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,760
You said coming south
would spark ideas for my work.

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,680
I have a hangover and a lack of sleep.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,600
And you just had to send
some idiot to pick me up.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,600
Time to raise a cat.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,080
How much do I need to pay you
to stop getting on my nerves?

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,600
Khun Connor’s paid me,
so I have to take care of you.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,320
And more importantly, I can
do more than just being a guide.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,640
Even if you were the last man
on Earth, I still wouldn’t want you.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,640
Mahasamut!

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,920
I thought you fell into the water.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,680
I thought you wouldn’t come back up.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,400
I thought you were going to die.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,080
I’m sorry, Khun Tongrak.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,240
Sometimes, I wonder...

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,879
what this man’s sex tastes like.

16
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,160
Open your mouth.

17
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,680
No, it’s dirty.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,240
Come on, you’re hurting my feelings.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,479
I already washed my hands.

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
If dunking your hands in the sea
counts as washing them

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
I beg to differ.

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,479
Come on.

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,640
Saltwater kills germs.

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,120
I’d rather use a fork or chopsticks.

25
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,280
I forgot to bring them with me.

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,479
I’ve only brought knives.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,720
No spoons.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,600
Have some.

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,120
I dived underwater just to get these.

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,079
You’d have to eat underwater
to get clams any fresher.

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,160
Who told you to?

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,200
I told myself.

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
Please have some.

34
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,280
I’m begging you.

35
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,440
Do you know...

36
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,920
what I wanted to do...

37
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
when I first met you?

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
Piss me off?

39
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,760
No.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,520
I wanted to find out...

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,040
what these whiny lips...

42
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,079
tasted like.

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,040
Curious?

44
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,080
Ouch!

45
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,840
Let me see.

46
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,880
Oww!

47
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,680
Be gentle.

48
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
You’re so clumsy.

49
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,159
Guess I’ll have to find out next time.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,159
There won’t be next time.

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,760
We’ll see about that.

52
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
But now, I'll go see
if I can find a first aid kit.

53
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,840
I have to get someone tonight.

54
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,800
You’re good at talking to yourself.

55
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960

yourself up for half an hour.

How did you know?

67

P’ Rak.

68
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,240
Pick up the phone.

69
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,560
You need to tell P’ Vie that she
can’t order me around like this.

Come what may, Ai Mook.

71
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,160
And Ai Rak won’t answer the phone.

72
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,320
At this hour, he’s either sleeping
or fooling around with some guy.

73
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,120
Come in.

74
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,320
P’ Rak’s not that kind of person.

75
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,680
Oww.

76
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,840
Hurry up, it hurts.

77
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Almost done.

78
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,000
This’ll hurt a little.

79
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,320
Oww, faster!

80
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,880
Okay.

81
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,240
Done.

82
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,920
I don’t have a first aid kit.

83
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,960
I’ve taken the shell out
and put on the bandage.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,680
It hurts.

85
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
I’ve taken everything out.

86
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,920
There, there, you’ll feel better soon.

87
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,640
I’m not a child.

88
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,840
Don’t treat me like one.

89
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,800
Well.

90
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,200
Wasn’t it you who whined, “Oww, it hurts”?

91
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,640
It’s just a tiny scratch.

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,480
Hey.

93
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,680
I can cast the pain away.

94
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,520
It’s dirty.

95
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,480
Not a single part of you...

96
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,159
is dirty.

97
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,280
I…

98
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,280
won’t take you to bed.

99
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,360
This isn’t a bed.

100
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,120
Open your mouth.

101
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,360
Not your turn.

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
Wait, stop.

103
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,640
Why?

104
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,960

105
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,760
Take me back to my room.

106
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,560
Now.

107
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,640

Did you forget?

124

I’m a woman who can’t

P’ Vie.

130

I washed all the clothes
you’ve left piled up for weeks.

131

What?

Don’t tell me you want
me to wash the dishes.

P’ Vie.

145
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,120
I’m hungry.

146
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,080
I’ve only had water and
an apple since yesterday.

147

Can you order takeout for me?

I don’t even have the energy

Will I have the strength
to go buy food myself?

150
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,040
Oww, my stomach hurts so much.

151
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
But you have the strength
to pull my arm?

152
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,720
Oww.

153
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,240
- Should I go to the hospital?
- Well…

154

Okay, okay, okay.

155
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,800
I'll order takeout for you.

156
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,320
Pick it up.

157
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,640
And then head home.

158
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
Don’t forget to order one for yourself.

159
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,720
Okay.

160
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,320
Okay.

161
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,800
If you keep staring,
I’ll have to charge you.

162

I usually work after the money’s in.

163
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,840
I gave you top-notch service earlier.

164
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,000
But now you’re ogling me for free?

165
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,640
What a loss, Ai Mut.

166
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,120
How much?

167
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,280
For the service at the beach.

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,680
How much do I need to
pay you to sleep with me?

169
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,400
How much do I need
to pay you to screw me?

170
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,560
How much does it cost to buy you?

171
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,720
I’m expensive.

172
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,440
I can afford it.

173
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,360
Quite the biter, aren’t you?

174
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,840
Are you a dog or something?

175
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,520
Woof.

176
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,200
Condom.

177
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,680
In the suitcase.

178
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Get up if you’re done.

179
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
I’ll get back to work.

180
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,520
Do I have to leave now?

181
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,040
Yeah.

182
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,520
You blew your load,
so you’d better hit the road.

183
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,480
What are you staying here for?

184
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,440
Kicking me out after
you’ve had your fun?

185
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,920
Dump the condoms outside.

186
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,440
Lock the door when you leave.

187
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,840
No emotional parting hug?

188
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,440
Get out.

189
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,760
Want me to help clean up?

190
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,920
I said, get out!

191
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,760
Okay.

192
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,640
I’ll see you tomorrow.

193
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,640
That was fucking good.

194
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,200
This is so terrible.

195
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,160
The laundry’s done.

196
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
The room's tidy.

197
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,520
The light bulb's replaced.

198
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,960
And you’ve eaten.

199
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
So, I'm heading home now.

200
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,000
Hold on.

201
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,160
What else do you want, P' Vie?

202
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,280
I’m not your servant
who you can order around.

203
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,560
I’m P’ Rak’s secretary, but I’ve
never had to do as much for him.

204
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,320
At least, P’ Rak can order takeout himself.

205
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,800
I’ve done all this for you

206
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,000
but you still won’t let me go home?

207
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,080
I’m exhausted to the bone.

208
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
I’m not stopping you from going home.

209
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,800
I just want to give you a little reward.

210
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,680
Don’t tell me you want me
to clean the bathroom.

211
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,800
A reward for the competent secretary.

212
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,160
A kiss from the lead actress.

213
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,040
Bye-bye.

214
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,800
(Mahasamut)

215
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
(Southern dialect)
Did you haul in many crabs?

216
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
(Southern dialect) Sure did.

217
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,160
Hey, P’ Mut.

218
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,480
Hold on.

219
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,600
Where are you off to this early?

220
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,400
I’m an early bird, but
what time did you return?

221
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,040
What else can I do?

222
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,800
Whenever you don’t have jobs for me

223
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,440
I’ve got to work at the bar.

224
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,840
And I was drunk as a skunk last night.

225
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,160
I threw up nonstop.

226
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,000
Go get some rest.

227
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,080
Gotta go.

228
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,320
Hey, hold on.

229
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,200
Have you heard about
your handsome guest?

230
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,200
Here’s the thing.

231
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,520
The lobby staff won’t
just shut up about him.

232
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Word is, he’s a millionaire’s son.

233
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Others say he’s here
to heal his broken heart.

234
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,960
Most Bangkokians stay here
for a few days, but not him.

235
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,440
Now people are starting to bet.

236
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,640
On what?

237
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,720
On who’s gonna pick the handsome guy up.

238
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,280
Many want to take a chance
with someone out of their league

239
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
hoping they might get lucky
and marry into money.

240
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,920
Even the pretty receptionist is interested.

241
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,600
No one would ever refuse
such a handsome young master.

242
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,880
I doubt there’s a chance.

243
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,160
Khun Tongrak won’t be interested.

244
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,800
So, what else?

245
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,400
Who’s placing a bet on this?
Spill the beans.

246
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,200
Don’t tell me that you
and your handsome guest…

247
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,320
Gotta go.

248
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
Hey, tell me first so I
can make the right bet.

249
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,400
And give me back my snack.

250
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,200
What’s up with him?

251
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,200
Come on, let’s hurry back.

252
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,160
Khun Nene’s really
working us to the bone.

253
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,040
Ai Mut’s picked up some real charm from me.

254
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,400
One downside is, he snags
all the girls for himself.

255
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,240
He's totally living up to his name
with that hotness and charm.

256
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,080
What exactly do you mean by that?

257
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,160
Just look at me. I’m hot too.

258
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,600
He’s rugged and so am I.

259
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,760
You’re delulu.

260
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,280
Come on, let’s get back to work
before the boss starts nagging.

261
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,640
(45,000 baht received)

262
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,520
From who?

263
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,960
I don’t like sharing things with anyone.

264
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,280
Have you gone nuts
from seeing the money?

265
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,400
I can’t go nuts.

266
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,000
My owner…

267
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,200
wouldn’t want to sleep with a nutjob.

268
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,760
Look.

269
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,680
I’m not possessive of you.

270
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,760
You’re free to date whoever you want.

271
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,000
You can sleep with whoever you want.

272
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,520
But once I’ve paid you, you’re mine.

273
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,200
That’s it.

274
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,240
I’m hungry.

275
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,720
And I’m tired of the resort’s food.

276
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,280
There’s no Uber ride around here.

277
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
I can’t ride a motorcycle.

278
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Take me out to eat.

279
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,760
Okay.

280
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,160
I know a good place.

281
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,200
I’ll take you there.

282
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,080
Let’s go, then.

283
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,440
Which bike?

284
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,200
Hold on.

285
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm taking you there,
but don't expect me to pay.

286
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,920
You eat.

287
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,880
You pay.

288
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,640
Okay?

289
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,360
I know that.

290
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,760
It’s my meal, so it’s on me to pay.

291
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,720
Why?

292
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,840
Someone forced you to pay for them?

293
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,280
You’re so darn cute sometimes.

294
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,120
Let’s go.

295
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,040
Hurry up.

296
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,520
Is it tight?

297
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,360
Yeah.

298
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,840
Bear with it.

299
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,640

You’re not getting off?

313
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
It’s hot out here.

314
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,640
Won’t you get off?

315
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,400
It hurts.

316
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,200
Huh?

317
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,280
Come again?

318
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,440
What hurts?

319
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,680
Why are you mad at me?

320
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,200
Because it hurts.

321
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,800
What hurts?

322
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,240
Tell me.

323
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,880
My butt!

324
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,160
My butt hurts.

325
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,320
It’s all your fault.

326
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,600
You didn’t warn me that
riding a bike would hurt like this.

327
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,320
(Southern dialect)
Who told you to be so cute?

328
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,720
What did you say?

329
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,360
Aren’t you afraid of people
seeing you kissing a guy?

330
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,360
Then are you afraid of people
seeing you hugging a guy?

331
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,400
No.

332
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,120
I’m clear about where I stand.

333
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,560
Besides, I’m asking you first.

334
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,480
Because it’s your hometown.

335
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,280
I don’t care what
anyone thinks either.

336
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,280
Oh.

337
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,400
Interested in me now?

338
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,400
What did you say earlier?

339
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,280
I said…

340
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,280
I’ll be more gentle tonight.

341
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,480
I knew it.

342
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,960
Wouldn't expect
anything less from P’ Mut.

343
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,800
(Southern dialect)
“Who told you to be so cute?”

344
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,720
It doesn’t mean “Be more gentle.”

345
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,520
It means “Who told you to be so cute?”

346
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
What a sweet talker.

347
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,880
I’m gonna scoop the pot for sure.

348
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,280
What should my victory meal be?

349
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,640
Done talking?

350
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,440
Yeah.

351
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,360
I just stopped by to
remind the villagers

352
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,080
about the community
event next week.

353
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,160
Come on, let’s go eat.

354
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,520
P' Mut.

355
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,880
My best bro.

356
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,280
Let’s have a chat.

357
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,040
Oh, the handsome bro.

358
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,480
Remember me?

359
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,000
- Remember?
- Hey!

360
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,640
Remember?

361
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,080
- “Treasure of the island.”
- That’s right.

362
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,960
I sold you on the treasure of the island.

363
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,320
Well, well, well.

364
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,080
Looks like my effort paid off after all.

365
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,000
You guys were all over each other.

366
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,200
And here I thought
you weren’t interested.

367
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,000
So, what do you think?

368
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,720
My bro’s really something, huh?

369
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,240
I’m pretty skilled,
if I do say so myself.

370
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,480
Don’t you think so?

371
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,160
I’m going to let everyone know

372
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,200
that you and your lackey
are in cahoots to trick tourists.

373
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,199
About the treasure of the island stuff?

374
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,800
I didn’t force you to buy me.

375
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,320
I’d better tell you something.

376
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,719
- I don’t want to know.
- But I want to tell you.

377
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,120
- I don’t want to listen.
- Just listen for a bit.

378
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:20,600
No.

379
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
Then I’ll just talk to myself.

380
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,560
I admit.

381
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,560
I paid Ai Palm to advertise
to the resort’s guests.

382
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,960
See? I knew it.

383
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,360
I’m going to tell the resort manager that
you and your bro are deceiving the guests.

384
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,480
But I paid him to advertise
my diving packages.

385
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,560
But I heard it.

386
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,760
Look.

387
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,159
Why would I sell my body?

388
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,920
I'm not a prostitute.

389
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,840
He's the one saying all that.

390
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,080
Do you really think a small
operator’s diving packages

391
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,280
will be included in a resort's services?

392
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,200
It’s not that simple.

393
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
At first

394
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,960
I hired the local kids

395
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,680
and asked my friends working at resorts

396
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,560
to promote them to the guests.

397
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,720
I’d been doing that for years.

398
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,120
Even got kicked out sometimes.

399
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
It wasn’t until recently

400
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,200
that people started showing
interest in local businesses.

401
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,000
Some resorts are willing
to support the locals.

402
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,800
The resort you’re staying in
is one of them.

403
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,480
Hey.

404
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,640
Why don’t you tell him that
you’re the leader of the locals too?

405
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,800
He may not look it

406
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,000
but he’s the force behind
the people around here.

407
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,040
People used to laugh at him.

408
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,280
And look at him now.

409
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,680
So fluent in foreign languages.

410
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,560
Even the resort higher-ups are
willing to have a chat with him.

411
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,840
And this place got
some help from him too.

412
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,880
When did I ever help you?

413
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,560
It was all your doing.
It’s got nothing to do with me.

414
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,360
Little brat, you blew off my compliment.

415
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,760
You’re always like this, you brat.

416
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,840
I’m so pissed.

417
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,720
What’s wrong?

418
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,480
Are you looking at me like that
because you've fallen for me?

419
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,680
Those boats.

420
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,280
Are they all fishing boats?

421
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
That’s right.

422
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,400
There used to be more of them.

423
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,600
The one you’re looking at
belongs to my dad.

424
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,360
Your boat?

425
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,560
My dad’s, not mine.

426
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,840
Same difference.

427
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,080
No.

428
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,480
It's not the same thing

429
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,120
because my dad cut ties
with me a long time ago.

430
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,560
My dad and I have never
really seen eye to eye.

431
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,280
He kicked me out of the house.

432
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,840
So, I ran away and never returned.

433
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,560
You’re joking, right?

434
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Come on.

435
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,080
Why would I do that?

436
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,080
You can ask anyone on the island.

437
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,360
Everyone knows about it.

438
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,640
I was around 15 back then.

439
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,800
15?

440
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,800
How did you survive?

441
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,080
I went to live with my aunt.

442
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,480
And did every odd job I could find.

443
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,000
I bet you won’t believe
that I've done every job

444
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,960
on this island.

445
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,040
Whatever gets me paid, I've done it all.

446
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,640
Why won’t you go back home?

447
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,840
My dad never takes back what he says.

448
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,400
I suppose that’s the only thing
we have in common.

449
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,440
Do you think I’m pitiful?

450
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,280
If you do...

451
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,560
then I am.

452
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:17,840
If you don’t...

453
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,960
then I’m not.

454
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,520
But I want to tell you that...

455
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,960
I never pity myself.

456
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,960
What about you?

457
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,880
Do you pity me?

458
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,160
No.

459
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,560
Thank you.

460
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,720
What about you?

461
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,440
Why did you become a writer?

462
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
𝘉𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘐 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘳𝘶𝘯 𝘢𝘸𝘢𝘺.

463
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,080
Because it’s fun.

464
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,480
That’s it?

465
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,800
Yeah.

466
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,760
It was fun at first.

467
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,320
What about now?

468
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,040
When I started writing...

469
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,000
I just wanted to share a story
I loved with like-minded people.

470
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,720
But as the reader base grew...

471
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,800
some groups of people
started finding faults with it.

472
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,000
“Why did this character do that?”

473
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,640
Why, why, why?

474
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,840
It’s just like when people ask why
there are dragons in a fantasy world.

475
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,280
Because it’s a fantasy world,
so of course it has dragons.

476
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,800
Illogical things...

477
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,960
can only happen in fictional worlds.

478
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,240
So, are you happy with what you do?

479
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,680
If I weren’t...

480
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,520
then there wouldn’t be Tongrak, the writer.

481
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,240
That’s all there is to life.

482
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,360
And you’ve been doing a good job.

483
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,520
No one’s ever complimented me.

484
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,800
Then I’ll do it.

485
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,560
So have you.

486
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,560
Let’s eat.

487
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,600
What about you?

488
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,200
Why did you become a writer?

489
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,720

497
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,720
Shall we go diving tomorrow?

498
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,680
All set.

499
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,800
Why is he coming with us?

500
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,680
I need an assistant when go diving.

501
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,400
Someone has to control the boat
while I take guests diving.

502
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,080
Why does it have to be him?

503
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,160
Ai Palm works for me.

504
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,640
He only does part-time
shifts at bars at night.

505
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,080
He’s usually always with me
during busy seasons.

506
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,280
Or do you want to do
something else with me?

507
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,880
That’s why you don’t
want him to tag along.

508
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,360
Don’t bite your lip.

509
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,960
The more you do it...

510
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,440
the more I want to kiss you.

511
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,120
On the boat sounds interesting.

512
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,360
But you could get seasick.

513
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,880
Why are you smiling?

514
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,280
Are we not setting off?

515
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,760
You’re lucky you’re my bro.

516
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,120
Let’s go.

517
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,080
Wait here.

518
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,120
Be right back.

519
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
- Ai Palm.
- Yes?

520
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,560
I’m gonna dive for an hour.

521
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:17,840
Okay.

522
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,280
Then…

523
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,920
I’ll start cooking in about half an hour.

524
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,680
Okay.
What’s there to eat?

525
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,920
Shrimp and squid.

526
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,960
Can he eat raw food?

527
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,120
I guess so.

528
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:31,760
Hey!

529
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,440
Ai Palm, give me a hand.

530
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,800
Weight belt.

531
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,040

534
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,480
I’ve given you everything I have.

535
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,440
Are you just going to abandon us?

536
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,520
Abandon your son?

537
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,400
Why did he leave me, Rak?

538
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,400
Is it because I’m pregnant with his baby?

539
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,400
I can’t take it anymore.

547
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,720
Have you calmed down?

548
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,920
I know...

549
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,760
that you’re certified for diving.

550
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,280
But you know, right?

551
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,320
Amateurs don’t dive alone.

552
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,960
They need buddies.

553
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,120
You can’t go down solo.

554
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,680
I’m sorry.

555
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,800
Drink some.

556
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,000
Are you okay?

557
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,720
Why did you panic?

558
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,160
Mahasamut.

559
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,640
Why is your name Mahasamut?

560
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,160
Strange.

561
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,280
And why is your name Tongrak?

562
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,440
It’s strange too.

563
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,680
I’m asking you first.

564
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,760
It’s so that our names can rhyme, I guess.

565
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,520
Did you fail Thai?

566
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,040
They don’t rhyme at all.

567
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,040
Well…

568
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:19,920
Tongrak. (Must love)

569
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,720
Mahasamut.

570
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,120
Ridiculous.

571
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,040
Nonsense.

572
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,760
Khun Tongrak - Mahasamut.

573
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,000
You must love me.

574
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,840
You’re aware, aren’t you?

575
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,280
Love is just a figment
of our imagination.

576
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,080
I’m hungry.

577
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,480
Huh?

578
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,400
Where is it?

579
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,720
What are you looking for?

580
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,160
Earlier...

581
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,080
I saw a reddish-orange fish.

582
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,200
But now it's gone.

583
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,520
You've seen it.

584
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,720
Where?

585
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,080
In the Tom Yum soup bowl.

586
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,440
You even said it tasted good.

587
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,520
There’s no need to remind me.

588
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:09,000
Thank you for being born so tasty.

589
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,640
Will you eat me if I’m tasty?

590
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:14,920
No.

591
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,920
Come on.

592
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,120
Even when I’m willing to sacrifice my life?

593
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
You still won’t eat me?

594
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,360
That’s you because you have to die.

595
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,120
I’d rather not eat you if that’s the case.

596
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,960
You say love is a figment of imagination.

597
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,360
Yes, it’s something we make up.

598
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,840
I like to imagine things.

599
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,080
You want me to buy love?

600
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,800
Just while you’re on the island

601
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,440
take your chances with me.

602
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,760
I want to go to your place.

603
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,360
Take me there.

604
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,200
Here, you forgot this.

605
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,200
I’m going home.

606
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,880
Where are you going?
Stay with me.

607
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,160
Will you be my girlfriend?
